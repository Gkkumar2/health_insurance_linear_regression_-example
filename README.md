## 📌 Introduction
This project implements a 🏆 Linear Regression model to predict health insurance charges based on features like age, BMI, number of children, smoking status, and region. The model is trained and evaluated using the `insurance.csv` dataset.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset used is `insurance.csv`, which contains the following features:
- 📅 `age`: Age of the individual
- 🚻 `sex`: Gender of the individual
- ⚖️ `bmi`: Body Mass Index
- 👶 `children`: Number of children/dependents
- 🚬 `smoker`: Whether the individual is a smoker or not
- 🌍 `region`: Residential region
- 💰 `charges`: Insurance cost (target variable)

## ⚙️ Installation
To run this project, install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## 🚀 Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd your-repo-name
   ```
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Regression.ipynb
   ```

## 📈 Model Performance
The model performance is evaluated using:
- 📉 Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- 📊 R-squared Score (R2)

These metrics help assess how well the Linear Regression model fits the data.
